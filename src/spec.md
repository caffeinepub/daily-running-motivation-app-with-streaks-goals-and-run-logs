# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh PacePower branding by replacing the current header logo with an updated PacePower logo asset.

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign the existing PacePower logo image and add the new logo file under `frontend/public/assets/generated`.
- Update the app header to load the new logo image instead of `/assets/generated/run-logo.dim_512x512.png` while keeping the visible app name text as `PacePower` and the logo alt text as `PacePower`.

**User-visible outcome:** The app header displays a new PacePower logo that works on light and dark backgrounds, while the header text and alt text remain unchanged.
